# VirtualBox Accessible Starter

This small and very simple application solves the most important accessibility issue of the [VirtualBox Virtualization solution](http://virtualbox.org) and makes it accessible to screen reader users.  
It Can make guest controls in the VM window accessible by starting VBox in a special way, as these controls are completely inaccessible for blind users in new versions of VBox.

## Details

The cause of inaccessibility of guest controls is that the VM process is reinforced to prevent other applications from crashing the VM.  
To work with an app, a screen reader needs to inject code into the process of that app. It cannot however do it to a protected VM process.  
VBox has a solution for this problem. This is a special VM running mode called the Separate mode.  
In this mode, VirtualBox starts the VM in background mode and then starts the interface to control it in a separate process.  
This GUI process is not reinforced and is accessible for many screen readers. The reinforced VM process stays in background.

This app makes that easy.  
You need only to start this app and then double-click your VM name or press the Enter key after focusing it. The app automatically starts the VM by passing the `--type separate` command-line argument to VBoxManage.

## Building

To build this app:
1. Download [https://visualstudio.com](Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 or higher). It can be a demo version or Visual Studio Community Edition. We need only command-line tools bundled with it. **Warning**! You must install the Visual Basic component as this app is written in Visual Basic.
2. Open the Visual Studio Command Prompt and then change directory to the folder where you downloaded or cloned the app.
3. Run the following:
`MsBuild VirtualBoxAccessableStarter.vbproj`
4. The resulting file can be found in the `bin/release` folder.
